*DESIGN OF HAMMING CODE AS ERROR-REDUCING  CODE*

**PROJECT GOAL :**

*  Our main contribution is to show a lower bound on the average number of errors remaining in the decoded message with standard decoding  while two errors are introduced by an adversary.

*  We also show that this lower bound is achievable for Hamming codes.

*  Standard decoding is not the best decoding method for the purpose of error reduction. We explore several other potential decoding methods for Hamming codes, and experimentally show that it is possible to beat the standard decoding lower bound on average number of errors. 

*  This demonstration will be followed by several algorithms that attempt to maximize the reduction in errors along with an analysis of the performance and scalability of each algorithm.


**OUTCOMES AND OBJECTIVES :**

* In this implementation we initiate the study of the error-reducing property for classical families of error-correcting codes. 

* It was found that the error reduction capabilities of Hamming codes are limited when standard decoding is used, inviting the study of other decoding methods. Several other decoding algorithms were implemented for Hamming codes and found to be more effective for reducing errors than standard decoding. 

* It is also of interest to explore other decoding methods to provide a greater level of error reduction with low complexity.

* Future work should address the best possible reduction that can be achieved as no lower bound is known in general. 

* Finally, it will be of interest to compute the error-reducing properties of other well-known families of codes such as BCH codes.
